# HOLiFOOD Dashboards
Committed copies of dashboard files in compliance with the stated objectives of Milestone 25.

## How do I get access to working versions of these dashboards?
Reach out to **support@cremeglobal.com** with your name, email address and organization in order to be provisioned access to the whole set of dashboards.

## What are these files?
These are *.qvf* files, a type of file containing information that describes how to render an interactive dashboard in Qlik Sense - what graphs, filters and tables to display, and how to display them.

## How do they work?
These files must be uploaded to a Qlik instance and populated with data from the HOLiFOOD platform; for confidentiality purposes the initial-commit version of these dashboards does not contain any of the data required for an instant visualisation on a Qlik Sense instance. Moreoever, it is bad practice to commit data to a repository like Github as it is not intended for storing data. Ultimately, it is recommended you simply reach out to Creme Global for access as setting up all of the constituent parts as an individual can prove time intensive.
